## Usage

This app is very simple to use!  

When the page first loads you simply follow the instructions: 

- Click the **"Pick A Date"** button!
- Select a date from the selector
- ....profit!!!

That is all there is to it.  You can select from any valid date and based on that date you will be bedazzled with NASA's "Astronamy Picture Of The Day", or **APOD** for short,  for that specific date along with a description.
